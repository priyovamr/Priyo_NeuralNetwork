# Priyo_NeuralNetwork
A neural network model who can conf
## Setting Up
1. **Install Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):** Consider creating a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. You can use tools like `venv` or `conda` for this.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the Jupyter Notebook:

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:** Open your preferred Jupyter Notebook launcher (e.g., Anaconda Navigator, Jupyter Notebook app).
2. **Open the Notebook:** Navigate to the Priyo_Neuralnetwork.ipynb file in your repository and open it in the Jupyter Notebook interface.
3. **Run Cells:** Execute the code cells sequentially in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Additional Tips:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** You might need to experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of epochs) to optimize the model's performance.
2. **Model Architecture:** Understand the model architecture, including the number of layers, neurons, and activation functions. This knowledge can help you modify and improve the model.
3. **Visualization:** Use visualization tools to analyze the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.
